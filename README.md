# Description #

***A sample extension/add-on for the WPCloudDeploy WordPress plugin.***

This plugin adds a "sample add-on" tab to the WPCD App Details page.
In that tab, there is a button that updates all plugins on the site, one that updates all the themes and one that exports the database.

You can use this plugin as a starting point to create your own
addons for WPCloudDeploy.
