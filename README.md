# Description #

**A sample extension to the WPCloud Deploy WordPress plugin. **

This plugin adds a "sample add-on" tab to the WPCD App Details page.
In that tab, there is a button that updates all plugins on the site.
There is another sample inactive button and an inactive text field.

You can use this plugin as a starting point to create your own
addons for WPCloud Panel (former WPCloud Deploy).
